FUNCTIONS
//define the function
1.int function -- returns variable
int Function_name(int needed_variable1,int needed_variable2[], double needed_variable3)
return output_variable;

2.void function -- returns nothing
void Function_name(int needed_variable1,int needed_variable2[], double needed_variable3)

//call the function
(1.declear the variable)
2.call the function
(int variable = )Function_name(needed_variable1,needed_variable2, needed_variable3);

Note:
*arguments sent by order; variable name doesn't matter!!!

when sending input to functions, there are two ways:
1- by value (give the value to instead of the address; any changes to the variable will not be accessible to the caller becasue the )
if the 
value can be sent by value or by reference
2- by reference (address of the book)
arrays are always by reference
int &variable;

*
//PROTOTYPES -- has to match exactly with the function below
ANYTIME U CHANGE THE NAME/DEFINATION OF THE FUNCTION, REMEMBER TO UPDATE THE CHANGES TO THE PROTOTYPE!
copy the head of the functions and put them before the main function
(C++ always compile in order -- line after line)


FILE I/O
step 1. ADD #include<string>;
step 2. open the file either for input or output
if u read, refer to ifsreanm;
  while (!file.eof())
  {
    file >> reportID[reportcount];
    file >> reportbedroom[reportcount];
    file >> reportprice[reportcount];
    reportcount++
   }

if u write, refer to ofstream;
step 3. save the file (outside the loop)
ofstream file("myfile.txt"); //open the file
cout - refer to the screen
file - refer to the file
file.close(); //close the file

remove indl -- easier for machine to read
