## CPP

**Overview**

This course emphasizes an object-oriented approach to solving computer programming problems. Using these techniques leads to shorter system development life cycles, increased programmer productivity, code reusability, and reduced system maintenance costs. This course provides a thorough, practical knowledge of object-oriented programming methods. Students learn the principles underlying programming using a language such as C++.

**Learning Goals**:

- Describe the form and structure of the C++ programming language.
- Follow the steps in the program development process.
- Use common methods and algorithms used in computer problem solving and be able to express those algorithms in the C++ language.
- Develop solutions to a variety of programming problems using the C++ programming language.

**Topics**

- Course Overview, Introductory Concepts,  Hardware, Software, the Programming Process, Types of programming languages, Integrated Programming environment
- Introduction to C++ programming:  identifiers, operators, types, cout, writing our first programs, programming style
- Controlling execution: Expressions. Formatting output. Debugging.
- Controlling execution: Decisions. Scope.
- Controlling execution: Loops. Counters. Nested loops.
- Using files.
- Reinforce control structures.
- Program design: what makes a good program? program structures, data structures, stepwise refinement. Possibly start Functions. One to two programs due by this date.
- Program design: Defining and using Functions
- Data design: Using Arrays (1-dimensional)
- Strings
- Data design: Structures (records)
- Data design: File I/O
- Pulling it all together: Objects and Classes
- Objects and Classes, continued.
