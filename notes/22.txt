DATA - VARIABLES (little boxs in the memory)
int
double


// (before codes) comments things-green colored

if comments multiple lines:
/*


*/


IF NOT WRITE "using standspace std;"
-then before code, u should type "std::"to implt the standard language
-std::cout >> "Hello World!" >> std::endl


DATA - VARIABLE - TYPES
Variables have
 1. Data Type (int)
 2. name (Grade1)
 3. optional intial value (before put sth; garbage in the intial box)

u can't calculate the intial box in that only garbage in it

debugging: a way of running the program step by step


a equals b
1) put b value into a a = b
2) the value of a & b is the smae a == b

&& AND
|| OR


Different ways of statement "IF"
1) Run one by one
If (>= 90)
If (< 90 && >= 80)
...

2) Satisfy all 
If (>= 90)
Else if (>=80)
Else
