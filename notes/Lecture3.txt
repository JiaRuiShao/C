3 knids of loop:
1) for loop
if u know the exact number of time u will repeat
2) while loop
if u don't know the exact number of time u will repeat
3) nested loop
loop inside the loop

common control variable for loop:
i,j,k,l

Data 
	Variables (int, double, bool, string, char)

Statements
	Input/Output - cin/cout
	Assignment/Expressions - calculations
	Decisions - if statements.
	Repititions - 
		for loop: if you know the exact number of times you will repeat right before starting the repitition, you use for loop. 

		i, j, k, l
		
		while loop: if you don't know exact number of times you will repeat before starting the repitition.

		do/while loop. 
		

		Nested Loops: 
		
		break; when encountered, immmidiately stops the execution of the repitition block and continues to the next statement after the loop. 
		
		
for loop depends on a control variable (a counter, an index)

while depends on a criteria. 

Scope of variables:
	
		
Functions: 
ability to put code into meaningful groups to carry out smaller tasks. 

ability to avoid repeated code.
