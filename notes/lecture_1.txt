1- assignments
2- computation (math computations)
3- decisions 
4- repetitions

Computers are good at:
	carrying out repetitive tasks concistently without mistake. 

Computers are bad at:
	ethics/moral concepts
	random numbers (pseudo random numbers)
	
Programming computers:
	very specific
	break down to simple tasks
	

1- Data: information stored or needed for the functionality to carry out a task. a piece of information (name, age, year, color)

2- Statements: Operation that are performed on the data. 
	math operations -- 00000001: add
					   00000010: multiplication
					   00000011: subtraction.
					   00000100: division
	i/o operation -- input/output operation.

Text Data uses a character mapping table to map characters to numbers. (ASCII: 1 byte per character, Unicode: 2 bytes per character)

Images: Every pixel has a numeric value.

INPUT -> PROCESSING -> OUTPUT

INPUT, OUTPUT are Data
Processing: a set of statements


a set of statements -- your program - C++ language

int x = 15 + 2;

a compiler -- takes the program in the language in which it was written and translates to machine language (ones and zeros)

an IDE -- integrated development environment. 

Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition 
	IMPORTANT: C++ does not get installed automatically, need to go to Custom install and check C++. 
	Only on Windows -- need to first run windows within your MAC if you have MAC. 
	

	
INPUT, OUTPUT: data -- variables in our C++ program. 

a variable name must start with a letter or underscore character followed by a letter, underscore char, or a number. 


cout << “”输出
cin >> “”输入
cout<<""<<endl;//刷新并换行
cout<<""<<flush;//刷新不换行，后继续输出在同一行
